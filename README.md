# HEBI
## What is HEBI ?
#### Hebi is Japanese :japan: for snake :snake:.
\
HEBI is a Snake-like **game** :video_game: built with Python and [pygame](https://github.com/pygame).

HEBI started its life as a learning project, expanding upon learning from [Teclado](https://www.teclado.com/)'s 30 Days of Python course.

HEBI features a classic Snake gameplay, with original twists.


#### Unique features include:
- Variable themes which change on every playthrough, guaranteeing a fresh experience each time.
- Pleasant animations between menus.
- More coming!


## How to use
1. If you do not have it installed already, download Python version 3.9 or newer from [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Copy/download this repository.
3. Run the 'main.py' file to start the game.


## Known issues
##### As of v. 0.1.0:
- Not all resolutions will work at the moment :x:. Tested working :heavy_check_mark: at 1920 x 1080 and 2560 x 1080.
- Rarely, when starting a new game, the snake will not move from its initial position. Quitting to main menu and playing a new game fixes this. Bug origin being investigated.
- The snake's movement is not as fluid as it could be, as the snake moves only in fixed squares. Considering how to implement intermediate states being drawn. Ideas welcome.
