HEBI changelog:

v. 0.3.1 - 14 June 2021
    > Hotfix for an issue where the program would not run correctly on non-Windows platforms due to a
        platform-specific import. The program now utilises a conditional import to offer the best of both worlds.


v. 0.3.0 - 14 June 2021
    > Added sound effects and music throughout the game, including in the menus:
        > There are four background music tunes right now, with one playing at random during each playthrough.
            > There are also multiple, slightly different variations of each sound effect, for sanity's sake.
        > Music pausing while the game is paused is temporarily disabled, as it was causing unexplained crashes.
            This functionality will be reinstated once the culprit is found.
        > Volume of music and sound effects can be changed independently by the user in the 'options' menu:
            > These loudness settings are permanently saved, and will be automatically used the next time the game runs.
    > The game should now scale correctly to most resolutions, although some unusual resolutions may feature overly
        large or small game elements, especially text.
        > The game is still missing dynamic scaling of text to arbitrary resolutions - this is likely next on the list.
    > The game now automatically detects monitor refresh rate (platform specific - should work on Windows), and sets
        an appropriately high refresh rate. If this is not possible, it defaults to 60 Hz.
    > Re-written the code governing where a snake spawns at the beginning of a game to be cleaner and better.
    > Reduced how close to the walls the snake can spawn - it will now spawn close to the middle every time.


v. 0.2.0 - 6 June 2021
    > The main change is the addition of a score system:
        > The game now prompts the user for a name, which it associates with the score for that run
            (or multiple consecutive runs if 'play again' selected after dying).
        > The game now keeps a copy of all user name-score associations in a JSON file:
            > In the future, this will likely be encrypted or obfuscated to make it harder to alter the scores.
        > The 'scores' menu option now has an early implementation, allowing players to view all previous scores, 
		in a descending order.


v. 0.1.0 - 25 May 2021
    > Initial release.
    > Game in playable state.
    > Some key functionality awaits implementation. These include, but are not limited to:
        > Support for any common resolution and refresh rate.
        > Music and sound effects.
        > 'Scores' and 'Options' sections, including permanent storage of scores.
        > A wider selection of themes.
